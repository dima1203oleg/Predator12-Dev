- **Celery Task Integration**: Enhanced endpoints like `/analyze-lobbying` and `/analyze-customs` to trigger Celery tasks for background processing of complex analyses.
- **Task Status Checking**: Added `/task-status/{task_id}` endpoint to check the status of asynchronous Celery tasks, allowing users to track progress.
- **New Endpoints for Nexus Core**:
  - `/simulations`: Endpoint for running 'what-if' simulations for the Reality Simulator module.
  - `/chrono_spatial_data`: Endpoint to fetch geospatial data for the Chrono-Spatial Analysis module.
  - `/ai_assistant`: Endpoint for AI assistant queries (text/voice) to support navigation and analysis.
  - WebSocket endpoints `/ws/3d_stream` and `/ws/simulations` for real-time data streaming and simulation updates.

## Frontend Integration
- **Real-time Data Fetching**: Updated `AnalysisPanel.jsx` to connect with the new backend endpoint `/api/analyze` using Fetch API for seamless data retrieval and display.
- **Component-Specific Routes**: Ensured distinct routes for different analysis panels like `LobbyingInfluencePanel` and `CustomsSchemesPanel` in `App.jsx` for targeted user experiences.
- **Enhanced Analysis Panels**: Updated `LobbyingInfluencePanel.jsx` and `CustomsSchemesPanel.jsx` to connect with `/analyze-lobbying` and `/analyze-customs` endpoints respectively, with improved error handling and loading states for better user feedback.
- **Admin Dashboard Enhancements**: Updated `AdminDashboard.jsx` to include detailed administrative functionalities, connecting to `/api/orchestrated-analysis` endpoint for system-wide analysis tasks with improved error handling and loading states.
- **Task Progress Tracking**: Added periodic task status checking in `AnalysisPanel.jsx`, `LobbyingInfluencePanel.jsx`, `CustomsSchemesPanel.jsx`, and `AdminDashboard.jsx` using the `/task-status/{task_id}` endpoint to update users on the progress of their analysis tasks.
- **Navigation Enhancement**: Added a new `Sidebar.jsx` component for easy navigation between different analysis panels, integrated into `App.jsx` for a cohesive user interface, with enhanced styling and a logout option for user convenience.
- **Header Addition**: Added a new `Header.jsx` component for a consistent top bar across all pages, integrated into `App.jsx`, featuring a title, user information, and a settings dropdown menu with options for user settings and logout.

## Observability and Monitoring
- **Enhanced Prometheus Configuration**: Updated `prometheus-config.yml` to include detailed metrics for FastAPI, frontend, Celery, PostgreSQL, and Redis with a scrape interval of 30 seconds.
- **Alerting Setup**: Added alerting rules and integration with Alertmanager for proactive monitoring and issue detection.

## Memory Optimization
- **Low-Memory Environment Support**: Configured services with memory limits in `docker-compose.yml` to ensure compatibility with macOS M3 (8 GB RAM) during development.
- **Remote LLM Usage**: Integrated remote API access for LLMs to reduce local resource consumption.

## Testing and Deployment
- **Comprehensive Testing Guidelines**: Added instructions for testing backend endpoints, frontend components, performance, database configurations, and deployment scenarios.
- **Helm Charts for Kubernetes**: Created `deployment.yaml` and `values.yaml` for easy deployment on Kubernetes clusters.

## Overview
Predator Analytics has undergone significant updates to enhance performance, scalability, and usability across various environments, from local development on low-memory systems to full-scale server deployments with the introduction of Nexus Core as the central interface.

## Key Updates

### Memory Optimizations
- **FastAPI Workers**: Limited to 1 worker in `main.py` to reduce memory usage on low-memory systems like macOS M3 with 8 GB RAM.
- **Docker Compose**: Added memory limits to services (e.g., FastAPI at 512m, frontend at 256m) in `docker-compose.yml` to ensure efficient resource allocation.
- **React Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy loading in `App.jsx` to improve frontend performance.

### Remote LLM Integration
- **Configuration**: Added `remote_api_config.py` for remote LLM API settings to avoid local heavy inference.
- **Client**: Created `llm_client.py` for interacting with remote LLM APIs like Ollama, HuggingFace, and Groq.
- **Endpoints**: Integrated remote LLM client into FastAPI endpoints `/api/analyze` and `/generate-insight` in `analytics.py`.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **LangGraph Setup**: Developed `agent_orchestration.py` for orchestrating multiple agents using LangGraph, enhancing autonomy and context-awareness with Redis and PostgreSQL.
- **New Endpoint**: Added `/orchestrated-analysis` endpoint in `analytics.py` for complex, multi-agent analysis tasks.

### Frontend Enhancements
- **Client Interface**: Created `AnalysisPanel.jsx` for client-facing analytical insights using TailwindCSS and Zustand for state management.
- **Admin Interface**: Developed `AdminDashboard.jsx` for administrative tasks, separated logically from client UI.
- **State Management**: Implemented `useStore.js` with Zustand for efficient state handling connected to new backend endpoints.

### Observability
- **Prometheus Configuration**: Created `prometheus-config.yml` with optimized scrape intervals (30s) for monitoring key services on low-memory systems.

### Deployment
- **Helm Chart**: Added Kubernetes deployment templates in `deployment.yaml` for scalable deployments of FastAPI and frontend services with configurable resource limits.

## Deployment Considerations
- Ensure Docker and Kubernetes environments are configured with the specified memory limits for optimal performance.
- Use remote LLM APIs for inference to reduce local resource demands.
- Review Helm chart values in `values.yaml` to match your deployment environment (local vs. server).

## Testing Recommendations
- Test FastAPI endpoints with limited workers to confirm stability on low-memory systems.
- Validate frontend lazy loading and state management for responsiveness.
- Simulate multi-agent orchestration tasks to ensure LangGraph workflows function as expected.
- Test Nexus Core components, especially 3D visualizations and WebSocket streaming, for performance and compatibility.
