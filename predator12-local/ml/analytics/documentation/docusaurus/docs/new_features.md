# New Features and Optimizations in Predator Analytics

## Memory Optimizations
- **FastAPI Workers**: Limited to 1 worker in `main.py` to reduce memory usage on low-memory environments.
- **Docker Memory Limits**: Set memory limits for services in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., FastAPI at 512m, frontend at 256m).
- **Lazy Loading in React**: Implemented lazy loading for components in `App.jsx` to optimize frontend performance.

## Remote LLM Integration
- **Remote API Configuration**: Added `remote_api_config.py` and `llm_client.py` to use remote LLM APIs, avoiding local heavy inference.
- **Backend Endpoints**: Integrated remote LLM clients into `/api/analyze` and `/generate-insight` endpoints in `analytics.py`.

## Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **LangGraph Implementation**: Created `agent_orchestration.py` for orchestrating multiple agents with fallback mechanisms and contextual awareness using Redis and PostgreSQL.
- **New Endpoint**: Added `/orchestrated-analysis` endpoint in `analytics.py` for complex analysis tasks.

## Frontend Enhancements
- **Client Interface**: Developed `AnalysisPanel.jsx` for client-facing analytics results.
- **Admin Interface**: Created `AdminDashboard.jsx` for administrative tasks, using TailwindCSS and Zustand for state management.
- **State Management**: Implemented `useStore.js` for Zustand-based state management.

## Observability and Metrics
- **Prometheus Configuration**: Updated `prometheus-config.yml` with optimized scrape intervals (30s).
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Created `predator-analytics.json` for visualizing metrics from FastAPI, frontend, Celery, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
- **FastAPI Metrics**: Added middleware in `metrics.py` for Prometheus metrics.
- **Celery Metrics**: Instrumented Celery tasks with metrics in `metrics.py` and added a metrics endpoint in `metrics_endpoint.py` on port 5555.

## Database Configuration
- **PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB**: Optimized `postgresql.conf` for analytical workloads with settings for memory, parallel query execution, and TimescaleDB extension.

## Deployment
- **Helm Charts**: Added Kubernetes Helm chart templates (`deployment.yaml`, `values.yaml`) for deploying Predator Analytics with optimized resource limits.
- **Docker Compose**: Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include Celery metrics service and memory limits for all services.

## Kafka and Celery Integration
- **Task Queuing**: Enhanced Celery tasks in `analytics.py` for asynchronous processing with Kafka streaming for real-time analytics results.

## Next Steps and Testing Guidelines

- **Testing Backend Endpoints**: 
  - Test the `/orchestrated-analysis` endpoint by sending various analysis queries to ensure the LangGraph orchestration handles complex tasks correctly. Use tools like Postman or curl to simulate requests.
  - Verify the `/api/analyze` and `/generate-insight` endpoints with different input data to confirm remote LLM integration works as expected.
- **Frontend Testing**: 
  - Test the `AnalysisPanel.jsx` component with client users to ensure it displays analytics results accurately and is user-friendly.
  - Test the `AdminDashboard.jsx` component with admin users to confirm all administrative functionalities are accessible and operational.
- **Performance Testing**: 
  - Conduct load testing on the FastAPI backend with tools like Locust to ensure it handles multiple concurrent requests under the specified memory limits.
  - Monitor memory usage and performance metrics via Grafana dashboards during testing to identify any bottlenecks.
- **Database Performance**: 
  - Test PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB under heavy analytical query loads to verify the configuration settings in `postgresql.conf` are optimal for performance.
- **Deployment Testing**: 
  - Deploy the system using the updated `docker-compose.yml` on a low-memory environment (e.g., macOS M3 with 8 GB RAM) to confirm all services run within memory constraints.
  - Test Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts on a high-performance server to ensure scalability and resource allocation are correctly configured.
- **Expansion**: 
  - Develop additional UI components for both client and admin interfaces, maintaining logical separation and enhancing user experience with TailwindCSS.
  - Add more detailed analytics tasks in `analytics.py` to cover other scenarios like lobbying influence and customs schemes.
- **Documentation**: 
  - Continue to update documentation with detailed guides for deployment, usage, and troubleshooting. Include examples of API requests and responses for each endpoint.
